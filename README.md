# IRduino
If you've ever lost the remote control for your TV or DVD player,
you know how frustrating it is to have to walk to, find, and use
the buttons on the device itself. Sometimes, these buttons don't
even offer the same functionality as the remote. When one of
my remotes went inexplicably missing, and I decided something had
to be done.
